      <div class="about-me">
        <p class="about-content">After seeing the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic hockey uniforms, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I am a fanatic about hockey jersey logos and designs, and I, along with many others, felt let down with this iteration of the Olympic jerseys. So, with some time, I decided to create what I think would be a better representation for Canada's uniform. I look through Hockey Canada's 100+ years of jersey designs. I incorporated elements of previous jerseys that I found to be visually strong. I decided to eliminate any black from the uniform design and went to strictly red and white as a nod to the Canadian flag. This would be the first jersey since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey jersey, and only the 7th jersey in Hockey Canada's history to only have a red and white colour palatte. I went through some logo revisions and refinements an came up with my own crest for the jersey. It's angular design represents the speed that Team Canada is traditionally known for. I incorporated the sublimated leaf pattern on the shoulders as a nod to the 2014 Sochi olympic jersey design, where both the Canadian Men and Women's teams went undefeated to win the Gold Medal. Lastly, I put a maple leaf on the left sleeve of the jersey as a sort of a nod to the expression "wearing your heart on your sleeve". I am proud to be Canadian and believe that anyone who has also worn a Canada jersey is too.<br>
          After completing this design, I started looking over Team USA's previous Olympic jersey designs, and began to create my own. A made my own USA crest for the logo using previous logos as a foundation to build on. The width of the letters in the crest are consistant and I elongated them to represent the striping on the USA flag. The stars on the top of the crest are another nod to the country's flag.
