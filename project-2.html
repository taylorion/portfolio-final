      <div class="about-me">
        <p class="about-content">When I was younger, I would always have a pencil and scrap papers by my side. I loved to draw and sketch as a hobby and as a way to kill time and to show off what I had done. As I grew up, that slowly turned into being interested in computer generated art. As soon as I was able to take a course in high school that offered this kind of content, I dove in and never looked back. I spent 3 years in high school taking a Media Arts course as well as being a peer tutor for one as well. Fast forward a few years and I’m now in my 3rd year of Graphic Design at Algonquin College. I find that all the assignments feel less like school work and more like fun ways to show off what I’m capable of. I’ve spent a lot of time working on the school work so I’m still finding my own style but am loving every second of doing so. I am excited to follow this path in the future and see all that it has to offer.</p>
