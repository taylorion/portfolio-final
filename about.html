        <p class="about-content">
          Hello, my name is Orion (/əˈraɪ ən/… oh-rye-in… oh-Ryan… Get it? Got it? Good.) Taylor and I am a current 3rd year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario. I have experience in freelance design work and branding.<br><br>

          I specialize in logo design and branding, but have experience in UI and UX design, motion graphics, and photography through my program at school. My main interest is sport related design - jerseys and logos - and how they connect a team to an entire city, province or state and even a country. It’s a huge part of my design interests.<br><br>

          My love for graphic design began when I was very young. I carried pencils and paper with me everywhere I went just for killing time and drawing whatever came to my mind. Fast forwarding through the years, I took a course in high school that fuelled my interest in graphic design and led me to take it in college.<br><br>

          My love for sports began much later, but has also had a huge impact on my life. I first began skating on a pond in my backyard, which eventually led to playing hockey for 6 years. I played soccer for all of my elementary and high schools as well in leagues throughout my area. Some of my most fond memories however, were as a member of the Brockville Rowing Club where I spent 9 years as a rower.<br><br>

          I am always up for new challenges and enjoy staying social (despite working behind a screen all the time), so if you have any projects that need doing, or just want to send an email, don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:contact@oriontaylor.ca">get in touch!</a>
