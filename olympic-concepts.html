      <div class="about-me">
        <p class="about-content">After seeing the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic hockey uniforms, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I am a fanatic about hockey jersey logos and designs, and I, along with many others, felt let down with this iteration of the Olympic jerseys. So, with some time, I decided to create what I think would be a better representation of various hockey uniforms.<br><br> I looked through Hockey Canada's 100+ years of jersey designs and incorporated elements of previous jerseys that I found to be visually strong. I eliminated any black from the Canada's uniform and went to strictly red and white as a nod to the Canadian flag. I created a new maple leaf logo and went through revisions and refinements and came up with the final crest for the jersey. I applied it to a mock-up hockey player to get a realistic look of the overall uniform. <br><br>
          After completing this design, I started looking over Team USA's previous Olympic jerseys, and began to create my own. I sketched out some new USA crest using previous logos as a foundation to build on. Again, after some revisions, I finalized the new concept. In the logo, the width of the letters are consistant with the negative space to represent the red and white striping striping on USA's flag. I referenced USA's flag to ensure that all the colours were exactly the same on the uniform.
